# Potato-Disease

By using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), it takes leaf image as input, processes it using some parameters and classifies it to a disease category. CNN takes an input image as Tensor (created from Tensorflow dataset). Each input image will go through sequential layers of convolution model with filters such as Maxpooling, fully connected layers (FC), etc. It uses Softmax activation function to classify the result. The model showed an accuracy of 99.2% on testing data.
